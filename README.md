# face-recognition-door-lock
This project implements a Face Recognition-based Door Lock System using a Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and MQTT IoT integration. The system detects faces via a camera, matches them against a stored database, and controls a servo motor to unlock or lock the door.
Features

✅ Face Recognition Authentication (using OpenCV & face_recognition library)✅ Automated Door Locking (servo motor control)✅ IoT Integration with MQTT (remote access & monitoring)✅ Real-time Notifications (via MQTT broker)✅ Secure & Customizable
